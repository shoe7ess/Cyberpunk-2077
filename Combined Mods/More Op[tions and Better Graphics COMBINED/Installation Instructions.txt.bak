Place the merged "More Options" and "Better Graphics" options.json file into:
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Cyberpunk 2077\r6\config\settings\platform\pc

The More Options mod is required, as it has another a seperate options.json file that is included and meant to be placed under:
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Cyberpunk 2077\r6\config\settings

Alternately you can just extract the .rar file into the \settings folder (which contains the More Options specific file as well as the merged options file.
