I made a slight tweak to the inputUserMappings that allows the mouse wheel to work with dialogue as well as LMB useable to select dialogue options (explicit dodge button as well as the ability to double-tap if wanted).
If you don't want the scroll-wheel/LMB dialogue ability, I've added a folder with the original default Better Controls Menu .xml files (dodge buttton is added by default with Better Controls Menu.

This .rar contains all modded files (the two input.xml files from Better Controls Menu and the two options.json files from More Options and Hidden Graphics.

Since Better Controls Menu does override the inputUserMappings.xml and inputContexts.xml, if you have any of the alternate controls mods you will need to copy over them. However with the added keybinds, hopefully it won't be necessary.
