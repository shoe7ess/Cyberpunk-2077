Extract the contents of Hidden Graphics - More  Options - Better Controls - ALL IN 1 into:
<path>\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Cyberpunk 2077\r6\config

Overriding as necessary.

I recommended making a backup of all files before overriding them, just good practice when modding game files like this.

Enjoy!

Again, a huge thanks to the brains behind the original mods:
srgamerio - "Hidden Graphics Options"
Nibrodooh - "Better Controls Menu"
XxCRAZYPOTATOxX - "More Options"
