# Cyberpunk-2077
Files specific to Cyberpunk 2077 (mainly modding)
There will be more to come after we can re-pack extracted meshes/textures but until then, there are a variety of mods that re-use the same .json/.xml files so I've taken the time to combine multiple ones into a single file so all of the options are available in game (pretty much just a merged mod).

Under "Copmbined Mods" you'll see two differnt merges. One with the Extra Graphics and Hidden Options, and one that has Better Controls (more in-game rebindable keys) merged with it. I don't see a downside to using all three (besides the upkeep on my part when the mods get updated), but it's nice to have options.

One thing to note, I do have a dedicated dodge button (rebindable) as well as the ability to double-tap dodge. I also added in the ability to use the scroll-wheel with dialogue options and the ability to use LMB to select said dialog options.

Recently I added a keybind for the QuickHack key, but I have not uploaded that merge because I don't want to make this more than just an ALL-IN-ONE mod and the more I customize, the more difficult it is for people who only want the two/three original mods merged and that's it.

I may start a Modded Merge as I add more QoL keybinds that aren't already included, but until then, enjoyu.
